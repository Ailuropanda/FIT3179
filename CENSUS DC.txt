sooo pretty much the code from Crime incidents refers to census_tract is connected to name of population variables but requires transformation as the census_tract for crime incidents is 000902 and refers to Census Tract 9.02.

For Census Tract 1 it is 000100

For Census Tract 14.01 it is 001401



Use python for Census Tract 14.01 remove non numerical values then add leading zeroes to add up to 6 digits.
