## Domain of Data Visualisation

Washington DC and its various economic variables that affect crime and each other, (Housing, Income, Poverty, Population)

##  Visualised dataset

The dataset is from https://opendata.dc.gov/ more specifically the data comes from DCGISopendata.


## Justification

I utilised two different maps currently as both the maps are not fully completed currently, the first map the dot map shows each crime in it's exact location whilst also showing the color of the specific crime allowing for a more precise analysis of each crime and its location and details (This utilises neighbourhood clusters instead of census clusters for geolocation).

The second map is a chloropleth map which will be used eventually to compare different forms of economic variables and their respective crime rates within those regions. This is the same map as previously used in week 9 however I've now added additional features that allow the graph to be visualised by its different types of crimes as well as a labelling mechanism to see which places homicides took place in with the text label being the form of homicide.
